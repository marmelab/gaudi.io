    <h1>HOW TO: Use gaudi Binaries</h1>

    <p>
        In lots of project, you need to execute task like <code>grunt</code>, <code>composer</code> or <code>bower</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        These binaries can't be included in container like <code>apache</code> or <code>php</code> because they not really rely on them.
    </p>
    <p>
        gaudi provides a type of components called <code>binary</code> that are simple executable started in the current container.
    </p>

    <h2>Define binaries in configuration</h2>

    <p>
        Each binaries should be defined in a <code>binary</code> section:
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/manuquentin/16bc16a4e0474b66f81c.js"></script>
    </p>
    
    <p>You can use all <a href="/binaries.html">binaries provided by gaudi</a>.</p>

    <h2>Start a binary</h2>

    <p>To start a binary in the current directory, simple run:</p>

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/manuquentin/8e187d63d884450fef6f.js"></script>

    <p>For example to run <code>bower</code> :</p>
